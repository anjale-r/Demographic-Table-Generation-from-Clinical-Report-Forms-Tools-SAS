# Demographic-Table-Generation-from-Clinical-Report-Forms-Tools-SAS

Utilized SAS procedures (PROC MEANS and PROC FREQ) to generate summary
statistics and frequency tables from raw CRF (Clinical Report Form) data. Created clean,
publication-ready demographic tables summarizing patient characteristics (e.g., age, gender,
race) for clinical trial reporting.
